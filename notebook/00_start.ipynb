    "    - Claims to lack macros and complicated flow control.\n",
    "    - Those things make C/C++ code unreadable, but is it a necessary evil?\n",
    "\n",
    " * Comptime\n",
    "    - I don't really understand what they're on about here... does the code help out in being it's own tooling?\n",
    " * C/C++ Compatibility\n",
    "    - Seems to be saying Zig will seemless integrates with C/C++ code out of the box. \n",
