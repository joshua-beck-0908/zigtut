    "`(const|var) identifier[: type] = value`\n",

    "Like in Rust, type annotations may be left out if the type is unambiguous; but must be used otherwise.\n",

    "No implicit declarations, you always have to put `var` (or `const`) before the variable if you are defining one. Good stuff, explicit is best. üëç\n",
