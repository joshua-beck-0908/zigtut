    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to be a statement that is executed after every loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's kind of like an alternate version of a `for` loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this syntax is a lot clearer than the classic for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just expression or are other actions possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "I added to the bagel program in ['test_loop'](../src/02_loopy/test_loop.zig) to try this out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` **statement** and `break` are also supported withing the loop. The continue expression is still run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall I like it, this is an interesting take one the while loop that combines with integrates the classic for loop. No mention of a *for-each* style loop just yet.\n"
